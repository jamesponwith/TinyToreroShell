The following requirements were not met:
- Correctly reap all foreground and background processes after they finish
  executing (i.e. produce no zombies).
- Have a correct implementation of the built-in cd command that changes the
  current working directory.

Grading Notes:
- Program has zombies: Did two consecutive siestas in background and this
results in zombies
- cd /home/sat/public does not work
- Very nicely structured code.
